# Task specification

`embodichain.gen_sim.task_spec` owns a simulator-independent normative task
contract, evidence evaluation and a content-addressed cache. It uses only the
Python standard library. Task generation, scene grounding, physical observation
and execution belong to callers; importing this package does not load them.

## Entry points and boundaries

| Request | Owner |
|---|---|
| Task roles and required properties | `contracts.py`: `RoleSpec` |
| Normative identity and ordered milestones | `spec.py`: `TaskSpec`, `MilestoneSpec` |
| Predicate vocabulary and temporal windows | `expressions.py` |
| Structure validation and evidence evaluation | `validation.py` |
| Cache reads, identity checks and atomic writes | `registry.py`: `TaskSpecCache` |
| JSON snapshots and semantic hashing | `canonicalization.py` |

Paths above are relative to `embodichain/gen_sim/task_spec/`.

Decode through `TaskSpec.from_dict`, then validate observation declarations when
required and evaluate supplied snapshots or trajectories. Both mappings and
existing instances undergo semantic-hash validation and yield independently
owned nested values. Frozen dataclasses still contain JSON containers: changing
one in place invalidates its original identity. Construct a new TaskSpec for an
intentional semantic change. Instructions, task identifiers and provenance
metadata do not participate in normative identity.

`RoleSpec.is_single_member` is a read-only query for `one` or explicit
`count=1`. It does not rewrite the authored selector, serialized fields or
semantic identity. Larger counts and `all` require complete separate binding
and evidence; they cannot be reduced to an available subset.

Milestone dependencies must be acyclic. All predicates for one milestone must
hold at the same snapshot strictly after its predecessors. Missing evidence and
incomplete temporal windows cannot certify success. Only an entirely satisfied
evaluation sets `certificate_ready`; the evaluator does not establish the
physical authenticity of caller-provided measurements.

The cache reuses a validated semantic identity across metadata differences.
It rejects corrupted or mismatched documents and publishes writes atomically.

## Focused validation

Run `python -m pytest -q --noconftest tests/gen_sim/task_spec` for identity,
serialization, cache, missing-evidence, temporal-window and milestone contracts.
The [API supplement](../../../docs/source/api_reference/public_api.rst) documents
the public imports. Provider calls and simulation runs are unnecessary for this
pure protocol package.
