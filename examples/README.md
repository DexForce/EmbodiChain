# Running examples

Use the path of any Python script under this directory, with or without `.py`:

```bash
embodichain run-example --list
embodichain run-example sim/motion/planners/curobo_planner --help
embodichain run-example ods/simple_bc_demo/train --help
embodichain run-example sim/atomic_action --skill place --variants 8
```

A directory with `__main__.py` can be selected by its directory path. All arguments
after the path go to the script, including `--help`; an optional `--` separator is
also accepted. `--list` discovers Python files from the directory without importing
them. Private files and `__init__.py` are omitted from the list.

Examples keep their existing command-line options and dependency requirements.
The launcher preserves the caller's working directory, so relative input and
output arguments resolve there. Package imports such as `examples.ods...`,
relative imports, sibling imports, exit codes and Ctrl+C reach the selected script.

Add new examples and their resources anywhere in this tree. There is no catalog,
registration entry, special example namespace, or required wrapper function.
Executable scripts should use the usual `if __name__ == "__main__":` entry point.

Source and editable installs run the checkout's examples. Wheels and source
distributions preserve this same tree and its resources; wheels install it under
`share/embodichain/examples/`. The CLI locates the installed data through the
distribution metadata and works outside the repository. Example code is not
installed inside the `embodichain` Python package.
