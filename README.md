EmbodiChain is an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated framework for Embodied AI. It streamlines research and development by unifying high-performance simulation, real-to-sim data pipelines, modular model architectures, and efficient training workflows. This integration enables rapid experimentation, seamless deployment of intelligent agents, and effective Sim2Real transfer for real-world robotic systems.

> [!NOTE]
> EmbodiChain is in Alpha and under active development:
> * More features will be continually added in the coming months.
> * Since this is an early release, we welcome feedback (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) via GitHub Issues.


## Key Features

- **High-Fidelity, GPU-Accelerated Simulation**: Combines realistic physics for both rigid and deformable objects with advanced ray-traced sensor modeling, all accelerated on the GPU for high-throughput batched simulations.
- **Unified Robot Learning Environment**: Offers standardized interfaces for a wide range of robot learning tasks, including Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
- **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Features a comprehensive toolkit for automated data collection, efficient processing, and large-scale data generation to fuel your models.
- **Efficient Training & Evaluation**: Supports modern training paradigms like online data streaming for Imitation Learning and massively parallel environment rollouts for Reinforcement Learning.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Designed with modularity in mind to easily integrate new robot platforms, environments, and learning algorithms.
