EmbodiChain is an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated framework for Embodied AI. It streamlines research and development by unifying high-performance simulation, real-to-sim data pipelines, modular model architectures, and efficient training workflows. This integration enables rapid experimentation, seamless deployment of intelligent agents, and effective Sim2Real transfer for real-world robotic systems.

> [!NOTE]
> EmbodiChain is in Alpha and under active development:
> * More features will be continually added in the coming months.
> * Since this is an early release, we welcome feedback (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) via GitHub Issues.
