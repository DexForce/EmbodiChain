EmbodiChain is an end-to-end, GPU-accelerated framework for Embodied AI. It streamlines research and development by unifying high-performance simulation, real-to-sim data pipelines, modular model architectures, and efficient training workflows. This integration enables rapid experimentation, seamless deployment of intelligent agents, and effective Sim2Real transfer for real-world robotic systems.

.. NOTE::
   EmbodiChain is in Alpha and under active development:

   * More features will be continually added in the coming months.
   * Since this is an early release, we welcome feedback (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) via GitHub Issues.


Key Features
------------

* 🚀 **High-Fidelity GPU Simulation**: Realistic physics for rigid & deformable objects, advanced ray-traced sensors, all GPU-accelerated for high-throughput batch simulation.
* 🤖 **Unified Robot Learning Environment**: Standardized interfaces for Imitation Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and more.
* 📊 **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Automated data collection, efficient processing, and large-scale generation for model training.
* ⚡ **Efficient Training & Evaluation**: Online data streaming, parallel environment rollouts, and modern training paradigms.
