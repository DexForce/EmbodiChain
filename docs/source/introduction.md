EmbodiChain is a unified, GPU-accelerated framework designed for pushing the boundaries of embodied AI research and development. It integrates high-performance simulation, data collection via real-to-sim techniques, data scaling pipeline, modular model architectures, and efficient training & evaluation tools. All of these components work seamlessly together to facilitate rapid experimentation and deployment of embodied intelligence and perform Sim2Real transfer into real-world robotic systems.

## Key Features

- **High-Fidelity Simulation**: Realistic physics and sensor modeling with advanced ray-tracing for accurate perception and interaction.
- **GPU-Accelerated Simulation**: Leverage GPU to run batched simulations with high throughput.
- **Unified Robot Learning Environment**: Standardized interfaces for both Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning tasks.
- **Data Scaling Pipeline**: Comprehensive tools for automated data collection, efficient processing, and scalable data generation.
- **Modular Model Architectures**: Flexible and extensible model architectures for fast prototyping and experimentation.
- **Efficient Training Infrastructure**: Imitation Learning with efficient online data streaming & Reinforcement Learning with parallel environment rollouts.
