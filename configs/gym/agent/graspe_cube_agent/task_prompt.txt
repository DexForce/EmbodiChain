Task:
Use a single robotic arm to Graspe_cube: pick up the cube on the table and place it into the container.

1. Move the end-effector to the cube and grasp it firmly, ensuring a safe approach that avoids collisions with the table and the container.

3. Lift the grasped cube vertically by about 0.10 m so that the cube is safely above the container walls and any surrounding objects.

4. Move the cube to a pose directly above the center of the container, maintaining a relative offset of [0.0, 0.0, 0.15] from the container pose to prepare for placing.

5. Open the gripper to release the cube into the container without further lowering, avoiding any collision with the container.

6. After releasing the cube, move the gripper back to a safe neutral pose above the table. At the end of the episode, the cube should remain stably inside the container, without touching or leaning on the gripper.
