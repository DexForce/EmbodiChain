Task:
Use both arms to pour water from the bottle into the cup.
First, grasp the bottle with right arm and the cup with left arm simultaneously. Then lift the cup by 0.10 m, and then move it to [0.55, 0.05] to prepare for pouring.
Then hold the bottle at a relative offset of [0.05, −0.10, 0.125] with respect to the cup for starting pouring.
After pouring, place the bottle to [0.7, −0.1] and place the cup at [0.6, 0.1] simultaneously.
