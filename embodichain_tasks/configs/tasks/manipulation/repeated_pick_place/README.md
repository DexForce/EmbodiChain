# Repeated Pick and Place

The Task Program repeats cube transfers between two authored target poses. The
physical environment is selected separately from the robot embodiment and program.

| Deployment | Robot component | Physics | Configuration |
|---|---|---|---|
| franka (default) | franka_panda | default | `task.franka.yaml` |
| ur5 | ur5_dh_pgi_140_80 | default | `task.ur5.yaml` |
| franka_newton | franka_panda | newton | `task.franka.newton.yaml` |
| ur5_newton | ur5_dh_pgi_140_80 | newton | `task.ur5.newton.yaml` |

Inspect the available deployments:

```bash
embodichain show-task embodichain_tasks:repeated_pick_place
embodichain run-env --gym_config embodichain_tasks/configs/tasks/manipulation/repeated_pick_place/task.franka.yaml
```

Each deployment owns its physics backend through its environment component. Choose
a deployment for another backend; `--physics` does not switch an existing one.
Task Program execution is the supported expert demonstration route. These original
examples do not independently qualify measured physical placement. No preview or
physical qualification result is claimed by this catalog.

The task-local `catalog.yaml` names deployments; it does not register a Gym ID.
Generate a simulator-free local gallery from the source checkout with:

```bash
embodichain list-task --config-root embodichain_tasks=embodichain_tasks/configs/tasks --category manipulation --export-html task-gallery.html
```
