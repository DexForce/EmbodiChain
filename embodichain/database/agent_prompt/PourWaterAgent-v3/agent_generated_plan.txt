**[PLANS]:**

Step 1: Grasp the bottle — `grasp(robot_name='right_arm', obj_name='bottle', pre_grasp_dis=0.10)`

Step 2: Move the bottle to the pouring position relative to the cup — `move_relative_to_object(robot_name='right_arm', obj_name='cup', x_offset=0.05, y_offset=-0.10, z_offset=0.125)`

Step 3: Pour water into the cup — `rotate_eef(robot_name='right_arm', degree=-90)`

Step 4: Return the bottle to its upright position — `rotate_eef(robot_name='right_arm', degree=90)`

Step 5: Place the bottle at the specified location — `place_on_table(robot_name='right_arm', obj_name='bottle', x=0.7, y=-0.1, pre_place_dis=0.08)`

Step 6: Return the right arm to its initial pose — `back_to_initial_pose(robot_name='right_arm')`

**[VALIDATION_CONDITIONS]:**

Step 1: The right arm should be holding the bottle securely.

Step 2: The bottle should be positioned at an offset of [0.05, -0.10, 0.125] relative to the cup.

Step 3: The bottle should be tilted, pouring water into the cup.

Step 4: The bottle should be returned to an upright position, held by the right arm.

Step 5: The bottle should be placed at the location [0.7, -0.1] on the table, and the right arm should release it.

Step 6: The right arm should be in its initial pose, not holding any object.
